# Chunk Loading Error Fixes - Complete Solution

## Problem Analysis

The errors you encountered are caused by:

1. **Chunk Loading Failures**: JavaScript chunks (like `637.531c842e.chunk.js`) failing to load with 404 errors
2. **MIME Type Issues**: Scripts being served as HTML instead of JavaScript due to routing conflicts
3. **Static Asset Path Conflicts**: Routes like `/auth/login` interfering with static asset loading
4. **WebGL Context Loss**: Three.js renderer losing context (secondary issue)

## Root Causes

### 1. Netlify Routing Conflicts
- SPA routing redirects ALL requests to `index.html`
- Static assets under `/auth/static/js/*` were being redirected instead of served
- Missing force flags on static asset rules

### 2. Webpack Chunk Issues
- Non-deterministic chunk naming causing mismatched references
- Missing public path configuration
- Improper bundle splitting configuration

### 3. No Error Recovery
- No error boundaries for chunk loading failures
- No retry mechanisms for failed dynamic imports
- No global error handling for chunk failures

## Complete Fix Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)

```toml
[build]
  base = "client"
  publish = "build"
  command = "rm -rf node_modules build && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && CI=false npm run build"

[build.environment]
  GENERATE_SOURCEMAP = "false"
  CI = "false"

# Headers for better caching and security
[[headers]]
  for = "/static/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
    Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self' https: wss: ws:;"

# CRITICAL: Force static asset rules come FIRST
[[redirects]]
  from = "/auth/static/js/*"
  to = "/static/js/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*/static/js/*"
  to = "/static/js/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true

# SPA routing comes LAST
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### 2. Enhanced Client `_redirects`

```
# Static assets with force rules (!)
/auth/static/js/* /static/js/:splat 200!
/auth/static/css/* /static/css/:splat 200!
/*/static/js/* /static/js/:splat 200!
/*/static/css/* /static/css/:splat 200!

# SPA routing (must be last)
/* /index.html 200
```

### 3. Webpack Configuration Fix (`config-overrides.js`)

```javascript
// Ensure proper asset loading with absolute paths
config.output = {
  ...config.output,
  publicPath: '/',
  filename: 'static/js/[name].[contenthash:8].js',
  chunkFilename: 'static/js/[name].[contenthash:8].chunk.js',
};

// Stable chunk IDs
config.optimization = {
  ...config.optimization,
  moduleIds: 'deterministic',
  chunkIds: 'deterministic',
  // ... rest of optimization config
};
```

### 4. Error Boundary Component

Created `ErrorBoundary.js` that:
- Catches chunk loading errors specifically
- Automatically reloads the page when chunk errors occur
- Shows user-friendly loading messages during recovery
- Preserves the current route after reload

### 5. Enhanced Lazy Loading

Updated `lazyLoading.js` with:
- Retry logic for failed imports
- Fallback components for persistent failures
- Better error logging and debugging

### 6. Global Error Handler (`index.html`)

Added JavaScript to:
- Catch chunk loading errors globally
- Handle unhandled promise rejections from dynamic imports
- Automatically reload the page to recover
- Preserve the current route during reload

### 7. Build Script Enhancements

Created `enhanced-build.bat` and `enhanced-build.sh` that:
- Clean build environment completely
- Set proper environment variables
- Verify build output
- Check for missing files

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Clean Build
```bash
cd client
rm -rf node_modules build
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build:enhanced
```

### Step 2: Verify Build Output
Check that:
- `build/_redirects` exists with the force rules
- `build/static/js/` contains chunk files
- No console errors during build

### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify
Upload the `build` folder or push to your connected git repository.

### Step 4: Test Deployment
1. Visit `https://blockchain-product-traceability.netlify.app/auth/login`
2. Open browser dev tools
3. Check for chunk loading errors
4. Test navigation between routes

## Why This Fixes the Issues

### Chunk Loading (404 Errors)
- **Before**: `/auth/static/js/637.chunk.js` → redirected to `/index.html`
- **After**: `/auth/static/js/637.chunk.js` → forced redirect to `/static/js/637.chunk.js`

### MIME Type Issues
- **Before**: Scripts served as HTML due to SPA routing
- **After**: Explicit headers and force redirects ensure proper content types

### Component Preload Failures
- **Before**: No error handling, crashes on chunk failure
- **After**: Error boundaries, retry logic, and graceful fallbacks

### Route Interference
- **Before**: All routes processed by SPA routing first
- **After**: Static assets handled with priority using force flags

## Expected Results

After implementing these fixes:

1. ✅ No more `ChunkLoadError` messages
2. ✅ Scripts served with correct MIME types
3. ✅ Successful component loading on all routes
4. ✅ Automatic recovery from transient loading issues
5. ✅ Improved Core Web Vitals scores
6. ✅ Better user experience with loading states

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] `/auth/login` loads without chunk errors
- [ ] Navigation works between all routes
- [ ] Page refresh works on nested routes
- [ ] Browser console shows no chunk loading errors
- [ ] Static assets load with correct content types
- [ ] Error boundaries activate if needed
- [ ] Automatic reload works for chunk failures

## Monitoring

Watch browser console for:
- ✅ "Critical components preloaded" success message
- ✅ No ChunkLoadError messages
- ✅ Proper loading states
- ⚠️ Any remaining error messages

If issues persist, the error boundary will automatically reload the page and log the issue for further investigation.

## Additional Optimizations Applied

1. **Performance**: Deterministic chunk IDs for better caching
2. **Security**: Content Security Policy headers
3. **Caching**: Immutable cache headers for static assets
4. **Development**: Better error messages in development mode
5. **Recovery**: Graceful degradation and automatic recovery
6. **User Experience**: Loading states and progress indicators
