   - Updated all hardcoded API references to use the new apiConfig utility
   - Enhanced search functionality to include product ID and certificate hash
   - Added improved error handling for API connection failures

3. **Backend Updates**
   - Enhanced CORS configuration to support multiple environments
   - Improved environment variable handling
   - Ensured proper port configuration using `process.env.PORT || 5000`

4. **Documentation**
   - Created `NETLIFY_RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md` with step-by-step deployment instructions
   - Updated `RECENT_PRODUCTS_TESTING.md` with more troubleshooting tips
   - Updated API endpoints in documentation to reflect deployment scenarios

## How to Deploy to Render & Netlify

Detailed instructions are available in the [NETLIFY_RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md](./NETLIFY_RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md) file.

### Quick Steps Summary:

1. **Backend (Render)**
   - Push your code to GitHub
   - Create a new Web Service on Render
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Set build command: `cd server && npm install`
   - Set start command: `cd server && node index.js`
   - Add all environment variables from your `.env` file
   - Deploy and note your service URL

2. **Frontend (Netlify)**
   - Update `client/src/utils/apiConfig.js` with your Render URL
   - Create a `netlify.toml` configuration file
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - Create a new site on Netlify
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `build`
   - Deploy and configure your domain if needed

## Configuration Files to Update

Before deployment, update these files with your actual URLs:

1. **apiConfig.js**
   ```javascript
   // For Netlify deployment with Render backend
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
     return 'https://your-render-app-name.onrender.com';
   }
   ```

2. **server/index.js**
   ```javascript
   // Define allowed origins
   const allowedOrigins = [
     // Development origins
     'http://localhost:3000',
     // Production origins - update these
     'https://your-app-name.netlify.app',
   ];
   ```

3. **client/.env**
   ```
   # Production API URL (change this when deploying)
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-render-app-name.onrender.com
   ```

## Testing the Deployment

After deployment, test these key features:

1. User authentication
2. Product search (including certificate hash search)
3. Recent products display on Home page
4. Product updates
5. File uploads to Cloudinary
6. QR code scanning

Refer to the error resolution guide if you encounter issues.
