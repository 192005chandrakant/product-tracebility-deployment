# WebGL Context Loss Handling Improvements

## Summary of Changes

We've implemented comprehensive improvements to handle WebGL context loss scenarios in the 3D components, making the application more robust and providing better fallback mechanisms.

### 1. FloatingCubeWrapper.js Improvements
- Added better error handling for WebGL context loss
- Implemented context restoration listener
- Reduced console spam by checking state before logging warnings
- Added better error fallback rendering
- Optimized performance settings

### 2. Scene3D.js Improvements
- Implemented progressive fallback (only switch to 2D after multiple failures)
- Added proper context loss and restoration event handling
- Optimized rendering performance
- Added state tracking for context loss occurrences

### 3. FloatingCube.js and BlockchainCube.js Optimizations
- Added try-catch in animation frames to prevent crashes
- Reduced animation frequency for better performance
- Simplified calculations for position animations
- Properly wrapped components with React.memo for optimization

### 4. ErrorBoundary.js Enhancements
- Added specific handling for WebGL-related errors
- Implemented a user-friendly error UI for WebGL issues
- Provided clear messaging about graphics issues
- Separate error handling paths for different error types

### 5. FallbackScene3D.js Improvements
- Enhanced animation for better user experience
- Better variant support for different scene types
- Improved visual appearance of the fallback component

## How It Works

1. **Early Detection**: We check for WebGL support on component mount and provide immediate fallbacks if not available.

2. **Progressive Fallback**: Rather than immediately falling back on first context loss, we count occurrences and only switch to 2D rendering after multiple failures.

3. **Context Restoration**: We properly handle context restoration events, allowing the application to recover if the graphics context is restored.

4. **Error Resilience**: Animation code is wrapped in try-catch blocks to prevent crashes if WebGL operations fail.

5. **Performance Optimization**: We've reduced animation frequency and simplified calculations to minimize WebGL context strain.

6. **User Feedback**: Better error messages and fallback UI provide a more professional experience even when errors occur.

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Consider Using drei's useDetectGPU**: For more advanced GPU capability detection, consider implementing the `useDetectGPU` hook from @react-three/drei.

2. **Implement Performance Tiers**: Based on device capabilities, you could render different levels of detail or effects.

3. **Test on Low-End Devices**: Ensure your 3D components work well on devices with limited GPU capabilities.

4. **Monitor Error Rates**: Set up analytics to track WebGL errors in production to help identify problematic devices or browsers.

These changes should significantly improve the stability and user experience of the 3D components in your application, especially on devices with limited graphics capabilities or in situations where the WebGL context might be lost.
