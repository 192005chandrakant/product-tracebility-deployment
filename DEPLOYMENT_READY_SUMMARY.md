## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Deploy Frontend to Netlify
1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Base directory**: `client`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `build`
5. Add environment variables:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://product-traceability-api.onrender.com
   GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
   ```
6. Deploy!

### Step 2: Update Backend CORS (if needed)
Once you get your Netlify URL, update the backend CORS settings to include it:
```javascript
// server/index.js
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'https://your-netlify-url.netlify.app'
  ]
}));
```

### Step 3: Test Deployment
