# Netlify Static Asset Test

## What was fixed:
1. **Problem**: Netlify was serving HTML content for JavaScript chunk files because the SPA redirect rule was catching ALL requests including static assets.
2. **Solution**: Added explicit rules to exclude static assets from SPA routing in both `netlify.toml` and `_redirects`.

## Updated redirect rules:
```toml
# Static assets should be served as-is (exclude from SPA routing)
[[redirects]]
  from = "/static/*"
  to = "/static/:splat"
  status = 200

# Manifest and other assets
[[redirects]]
  from = "/manifest.json"
  to = "/manifest.json"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/favicon.ico"
  to = "/favicon.ico"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/sw.js"
  to = "/sw.js"
  status = 200

# SPA routing - redirect all non-static routes to index.html
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

## Testing after redeploy:
1. Visit https://blockchain-product-traceability.netlify.app/
2. Check browser console for chunk loading errors
3. Test direct access to static assets:
   - https://blockchain-product-traceability.netlify.app/static/js/main.e05f0bc6.js
   - https://blockchain-product-traceability.netlify.app/static/css/main.*.css
4. Test SPA routing:
   - https://blockchain-product-traceability.netlify.app/auth/login
   - https://blockchain-product-traceability.netlify.app/products
   - https://blockchain-product-traceability.netlify.app/dashboard

## Expected results:
- ✅ JavaScript files should load as JS, not HTML
- ✅ CSS files should load as CSS, not HTML
- ✅ SPA routes should still work and redirect to index.html
- ✅ No more chunk loading errors in console
- ✅ App should load completely without errors

## If errors persist:
1. Check Netlify build logs for any issues
2. Verify the `_redirects` file was copied to build output
3. Clear browser cache and test in incognito mode
4. Check Network tab in DevTools for failing requests
