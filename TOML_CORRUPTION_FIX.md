# ðŸ”§ NETLIFY TOML CORRUPTION FIX - COMPLETED

## URGENT ISSUE RESOLVED:
**Error**: `Unexpected character, expected whitespace, . or ] at row 1, col 7, pos 6`
**Problem**: Corrupted `netlify.toml` file preventing Netlify deployment
**Solution**: Completely recreated clean `netlify.toml` file

## Fix Applied:
1. **Deleted** corrupted file: `[buil# Static assets` (broken)
2. **Created** new clean file: `[build]` (correct)
3. **Verified** proper TOML syntax
4. **Committed** and pushed to GitHub

## Clean Configuration:
```toml
[build]
  base = "client"
  publish = "build"
  command = "rm -rf node_modules build && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/static/*"
  to = "/static/:splat"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

## Expected Results:
- âœ… No more TOML parsing errors
- âœ… Successful Netlify build
- âœ… Static assets load correctly
- âœ… Chunk loading errors resolved
- âœ… SPA routing works

## Status: 
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED** - Netlify should deploy successfully now!
