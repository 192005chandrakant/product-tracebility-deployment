# API CORS and Rate Limiting Fix - Complete Solution

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed:

### 1. CORS Policy Blocking
- **Problem**: `Access to fetch at 'https://product-traceability-api.onrender.com/test' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy`
- **Solution**: 
  - Added development proxy configuration in `setupProxy.js`
  - Updated API configuration to use proxy in development
  - Added `.env.local` for local environment variables

### 2. Rate Limiting (429 Too Many Requests)
- **Problem**: Production API returning 429 errors due to excessive requests
- **Solution**:
  - Improved error handling for rate limiting
  - Added timeout reductions to prevent excessive requests
  - Better fallback logic for when API is rate limited

### 3. Failed API Connection Tests
- **Problem**: Repeated failed API connection attempts causing console spam
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced API connection test with better error handling
  - Added environment flag to disable API warnings in development
  - Improved logic for local vs production API detection

## üìÅ Files Modified:

1. **`.env.local`** (NEW) - Local development configuration
2. **`setupProxy.js`** (NEW) - Development proxy configuration
3. **`apiConfig.js`** - Enhanced API handling with proxy support
4. **`App.js`** - Improved API connection test with better error handling
5. **`package.json`** - Added proxy configuration

## üöÄ How to Test:

### Step 1: Restart Development Server
```bash
cd "c:\Users\Chandrakant\walmart-sparkthon\product-tracibility\client"
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C if running)
npm start
```

### Step 2: Verify Local API Connection
- Check console for: "‚úÖ API connection successful" 
- Or: "‚ÑπÔ∏è Running in local development mode"

### Step 3: Expected Behavior
- No more CORS errors in development
- Reduced 429 rate limiting errors
- Cleaner console output
- API requests should work through proxy

## üîß Configuration Details:

### Development Mode (localhost:3000):
- Uses proxy to `http://localhost:5000` (no CORS issues)
- API calls go to `/api/*` and `/test` endpoints
- Environment: `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`

### Production Mode:
- Direct calls to `https://product-traceability-api.onrender.com`
- CORS handled by production server
- Rate limiting respected with better error handling

## üéØ Benefits:
- ‚úÖ No more CORS policy errors in development
- ‚úÖ Reduced console spam from failed API calls
- ‚úÖ Better error handling for rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Cleaner development experience
- ‚úÖ Maintains production functionality

## üîç Troubleshooting:

If you still see issues:
1. Ensure local backend server is running on port 5000
2. Check that `http-proxy-middleware` is installed
3. Restart development server completely
4. Check browser network tab for actual request URLs
