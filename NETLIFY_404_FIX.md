# 🚨 Netlify 404 Error Fix Guide

## Problem
Your Netlify app is deployed at: `https://686f334ab5a53586bde63769--blockchain-product-traceability.netlify.app/`

But when you navigate to routes like `/products`, `/dashboard`, or refresh the page, you get a 404 error.

## Root Cause
This is a common issue with Single Page Applications (SPAs) like React. When users navigate directly to a route or refresh the page, Netlify tries to find that file on the server, but it doesn't exist because React handles routing client-side.

## ✅ Solutions (Multiple Approaches)

### Solution 1: Update netlify.toml (Recommended)

Make sure your `netlify.toml` in the project root has the correct SPA redirect:

```toml
[build]
  base = "client"
  publish = "build"
  command = "npm run build"

# SPA redirect - this is crucial!
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

# Environment variables
[build.environment]
  REACT_APP_API_URL = "https://product-traceability-api.onrender.com"
  GENERATE_SOURCEMAP = "false"
  DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN = "true"
```

### Solution 2: Add _redirects file

Create a `_redirects` file in `client/public/_redirects`:

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### Solution 3: Netlify Dashboard Configuration

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Select your site: `blockchain-product-traceability`
3. Go to **Site Settings** → **Build & Deploy** → **Post processing**
4. Add a redirect rule:
   - **From**: `/*`
   - **To**: `/index.html`
   - **Status**: `200`

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Update netlify.toml

```bash
# In your project root, ensure netlify.toml has the redirect
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Step 2: Update _redirects file

```bash
# In client/public/_redirects
/*    /index.html   200
```

### Step 3: Redeploy

Push your changes to GitHub, and Netlify will automatically redeploy:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix SPA routing with proper redirects"
git push origin main
```

## 🧪 Testing

After deployment, test these URLs:

1. ✅ **Base URL**: `https://686f334ab5a53586bde63769--blockchain-product-traceability.netlify.app/`
2. ✅ **Direct route**: `https://686f334ab5a53586bde63769--blockchain-product-traceability.netlify.app/products`
3. ✅ **Refresh any page**: Should work without 404

## 🔍 Advanced Debugging

### Check Your Routes

Make sure your React Router routes are properly configured:

```javascript
// App.js should have something like:
<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Landing />} />
    <Route path="/home" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/products" element={<Products />} />
    <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
    {/* Add a catch-all route */}
    <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/" replace />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

### Check Build Output

Ensure your build creates the correct files:

```bash
cd client
npm run build
ls -la build/

# Should see:
# - index.html
# - static/ folder
# - asset-manifest.json
```

### Check Netlify Build Logs

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click on your site
3. Go to **Deploys** tab
4. Click on the latest deploy
5. Check the build logs for any errors

## 🚀 Quick Fix Commands

Run these commands to fix the issue immediately:

```bash
# 1. Ensure netlify.toml has proper redirects
echo '[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200' >> netlify.toml

# 2. Ensure _redirects file exists
echo '/*    /index.html   200' > client/public/_redirects

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Fix SPA routing - add proper redirects"
git push origin main
```

## 📝 Verification

After the fix, your app should work perfectly:

- ✅ Landing page loads
- ✅ Direct URL navigation works
- ✅ Page refresh works
- ✅ Browser back/forward buttons work
- ✅ All React routes accessible

## 🎯 Expected Result

Your app at `https://686f334ab5a53586bde63769--blockchain-product-traceability.netlify.app/` should now:

1. Load the landing page correctly
2. Allow navigation to all routes
3. Handle page refreshes without 404 errors
4. Work with direct URL access
